# Tlk-Extractor-from-Mass-Effect-2

## Overview

Project was rewritten from https://github.com/jgoclawski/me2-tlk-tool.

Tlk-Extractor is a program to modify TLK files of Mass Effect 2 (All text lines including Dialogs)

You can load your TLK-file to get output XML-file. 
What is the reason of transforming TLK to XML? Because TLK-file is a non-editable binary file but XML is easy to edit the way uou want.
